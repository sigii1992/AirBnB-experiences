# AirBnB-experiences

This is a simple static data-driven web site with a list of different experiences. 
It is built in order to learn React basics:

- JSX
- Custom components
- It is data driven page (using data array in a separate data.js file)
- I am using .map() and props on Card components to pass data down to custom components and have React to display the array that has been mapped.
- Styling (using CSS classes)
